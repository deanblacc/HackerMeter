/**
 * A couple of friends are afraid of their nosy roommates looking at their LINE history, so they have the following discussion:
 *
 * X: I really don't want my messages to be read...let's start encrypting our messages. We'll replace each letter with a number. 'A' is 1, 'B' is 2, and so on...
 * Y: What. The. ****.
 * X: It'll be great!
 * Y: I guess you didn't study cryptography in college. But, just to let you know, that would let you decode words in different ways. For example, "ABBA" is the same as "LU".
 * X: Maybe there aren't that many ways to do it?
 * Y: Well, THAT we can find out. Where's your laptop?
 *

 *
 * The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 1000).
 *
 * The following N lines each contain a string S comprised only of digits (no spaces or special characters - just digits).
 *
 * For each test case, print the number of different ways there are to decrypt S.
